# z-value-p-value
# z-value-p-value
A package to calculate p-values from Z-scores.
# Z to P-value Calculator

This R package provides a simple function `z_to_p()` to calculate the p-value from a given z-value. The package supports both one-sided and two-sided hypothesis tests and can be used to quickly assess statistical significance in hypothesis testing.

## Installation

To install this package, you can download the source code and install it directly in R. Use the following code in your R console:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install the package from GitHub (if it's published there)
devtools::install_github("yourusername/z-value-p-value")

# Or install from a local path if you have the .tar.gz file
# install.packages("path/to/z-value-p-value_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

#Alternatively, if you have the .tar.gz file of the package, you can install it by:
#install.packages("path/to/z-value-p-value_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

#z_value_one_sided <- 2.5
#p_value_one_sided <- z_to_p(z = z_value_one_sided, type = "one_sided")
#z_value_two_sided <- 2.5
#p_value_two_sided <- z_to_p(z = z_value_two_sided, type = "two_sided")
